# HILSIM
To communicate with HILSIM server, we use protobuf to go back and forth.
Important links:
 - Protobuf: https://protobuf.dev/
 - Nanopb: https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb

You can run `generate_protobuf.sh` or `generate_protobuf.bat` to generate the protobuf files.

Do note that you will need the command protoc to run it. It can be found here: <https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protobuf-compiler-installation>

Protoc is only used to generate the python files, and the C++ files have to be generated by nanopb.
